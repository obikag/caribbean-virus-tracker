                                <p>
                                Coronaviruses are one of a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  
                                In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the 
                                common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe 
                                Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
                                </p>
                                <h5>What is COVID-19?</h5>
                                <p>
                                COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. 
                                This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019
                                </p>
                                <h5>What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</h5>
                                <p>
                                Symptoms vary with COVID-19 and not everyone will have the same features. 
                                The most common include:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Fever</li>
                                    <li>Tiredness</li>
                                    <li>Dry cough</li>
                                </ul>
                                Some patients may have:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Aches and pains</li>
                                    <li>Nasal congestion</li>
                                    <li>Sore throat</li>
                                    <li>Diarrhoea</li>
                                </ul>
                                These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but donâ€™t develop 
                                any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people <em>(about 80%)</em> recover from the disease without needing 
                                special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and 
                                develops difficulty breathing. Other at risk persons who are more likely to develop serious illines 
                                include:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Older people</li>
                                    <li>People with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes</li>
                                </ul> 
                                People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.
